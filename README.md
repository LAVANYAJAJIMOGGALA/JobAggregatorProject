# JobAggregatorProject
he Job Aggregator is a web-based application designed to help users search and discover job opportunities from multiple sources in one unified platform. Instead of visiting several job boards individually, users can access a centralized dashboard that fetches, filters, and displays relevant job postings based on their preferences such as location.
